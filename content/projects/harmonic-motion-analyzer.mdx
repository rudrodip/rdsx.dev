## Project Sections

The project can be divided into three major sections:

1. [**Programming**](#programming): In this section, I've covered the development of the user interface and the image processing pipeline, using libraries such as OpenCV and `cvzone`. The UI creation was straightforward, thanks to Python and PyQt5.

2. [**Mathematics**](#mathematics): In the mathematics section of the project, I utilize powerful mathematical tools to extract insights from the data

   - **Curve Fitting with `curve_fit`**: I use SciPy's `curve_fit` function to fit collected data points to a damped oscillation function. This helps me accurately detect and analyze harmonic motion patterns.

   - **`least_square` for Circular Path Detection**: The `least_square` algorithm is not only used for curve fitting but also for assessing the accuracy of circular paths. It ensures that predicted paths closely match the actual object motion, validating the precision of path predictions and harmonic motion analysis.

3. [**Physics**](#physics): While closely related to mathematics, the physics aspect primarily focuses on extracting physical parameters such as pendulum length and pivot point location. These parameters provide valuable insights into the object's harmonic motion.

This breakdown of the user interface and project sections should provide a clearer picture of the project's structure and functionality.

# Programming

Let's dive deep 🙂

## User Interface (UI)

Creating the user interface for this project was a relatively smooth process. Thanks to Python and PyQt5, I was able to design the interface without much hassle. While the UI design took some effort due to its complexity, it wasn't the most challenging part of the project.

## Image Processing

- magic 🪄

### OpenCV and cvzone

Image processing is where the real magic happens in this project. OpenCV is a fantastic library, and it played a central role in handling the video feed. It allowed me to perform tasks like object detection, tracking, and image manipulation with ease.

Additionally, I leveraged `cvzone` for contour detection, which was particularly helpful for identifying objects based on their HSV color range. This library simplified a crucial part of the image processing pipeline.

### Main Loop Workflow

The main loop of the project was the heart of the image processing section. Here's how it worked:

1. **Frame Acquisition**: At the beginning of each iteration, I obtained a new frame from the video feed.

2. **Contour Detection**: With the help of `cvzone`, I detected contours in the frame. This step was crucial for pinpointing the object of interest, often based on its distinct color range in the HSV color space.

3. **Pivot Point Estimation and Path Prediction**: This step was the real technical challenge. I used the `least_square` algorithm from SciPy to estimate the pivot point of the oscillating object. Moreover, I employed this algorithm to predict the future path of the object. This was essential for analyzing the object's harmonic oscillation characteristics, which I'll elaborate on in the [mathematics](#mathematics) section.

4. **Data Transfer to UI**: To keep the user informed, I sent relevant data, including the transformed position (`transformed_x`) and frame count (`frame_count`), back to the main user interface.

5. **Frame Rendering**: The current frame was also sent to the UI for real-time rendering, allowing users to visualize the object's motion and the ongoing analysis.

6. **Repeat**: These steps were executed in a continuous loop for every frame in the video feed, enabling the real-time analysis of the object's oscillations.

# Mathematics

In this section, I'll take you on a mathematical journey through the key tools and techniques that drive this project, making it easier to understand.

## Detecting Circular Motion with _least_square_

In this section, I'll walk you through the critical steps involved in using `least_square` to detect circular motion, **_even if the video is rotated_**. Let's dive into how I achieved this:

### 1. Contour Extraction

**Why?** To accurately detect the position of the oscillating object (the bob) in each frame.

**How?** I started by extracting the object's contours from each frame of the video feed. Contours are like outlines that provide precise coordinates of the object's location.

### 2. Calculating Residuals

**Why?** To assess how closely the detected path resembles a circle and understand any deviations.

**How?** I implemented the `circle_residuals` function, powered by `least_square`. This function calculates the differences between the observed data points and the expected points on a circle.

```py
def circle_residuals(params, x, y):
  """
  Calculate the residuals for circle fitting.

  Args:
      params: Parameters of the circle (a, b, r).
      x: x-coordinates of data points.
      y: y-coordinates of data points.

  Returns:
      Residuals indicating the difference between the data points and the circle model.
  """
  a, b, r = params
  return np.sqrt((x - a) ** 2 + (y - b) ** 2) - r
```

$$
\text{Circle Residuals: } y_\text{predicted} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - r
$$

Where:

- $$ \text{predicted}\_y $$ represents the predicted residuals.
- $$ r $$ is the radius of the circle.
- $$ x $$ and $$ y $$ are the arrays containing the x and y coordinates of data points.

This equation calculates the residuals for fitting a circle to a set of data points.

### 3. Optimization

**Why?** To fine-tune and optimize the parameters of the rotated circle for accuracy.

**How?** I let `least_square` do its magic. It optimized the circle's parameters, including center, radius, and rotation angle. This step ensures that the predicted circular path aligns closely with the actual object path, even if there is rotation in the video.

**The Result?** A robust method for accurately detecting circular motion, even if the video is rotated. It's like having a compass that guides us to the truth in a sea of data.

### 4. Pivot Point and Rotation

**Why?** To account for video rotation and accurately transform the object's coordinates.

**How?** When I identified the circular motion, I used a straightforward method. First, I calculated the average position of the pendulum. Then, I found the tangent between the pivot point and this mean position. This allowed me to determine the precise angle of rotation, which, in turn, enabled me to accurately adjust the bob's x and y coordinates.

**The Result?** This entire workflow ensured that I could analyze harmonic motion, correct for video rotation, and extract precise data for further analysis.

## Fitting the Harmonic Puzzle with _curve_fit_

At the heart of this mathematical marvel lies the `curve_fit` function from SciPy. This is where the magic unfolds, as I delve deep into the data to uncover the secrets of harmonic oscillations.

### Why ?

**Purpose**: `curve_fit` serves as my mathematical detective, deciphering the hidden patterns within my data. Its mission? To find the perfect mathematical equation that describes the object's motion.

**How it Works**:

1. **Collect Data**: I start by collecting data points that represent the object's position over time. These data points are like breadcrumbs left by the oscillating object.

2. **Select a Model**: I choose a model that I believe fits the data. In my case, it's a under damped oscillation function. This function includes parameters such as amplitude, omega, damping coefficient, and phase, which describe the expected motion of the object.

Equation for the under-damped oscillation function

$$
x(t) = A e^{-\gamma t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) + C
$$

```py
def underdamped_harmonic_oscillator(t, A, gamma, w, phi, C):
    """
    Calculate the position of an underdamped harmonic oscillator at time t.

    Args:
        t: Time values.
        A: Amplitude of oscillation.
        gamma: Damping coefficient.
        f: Frequency of oscillation.
        phi: Phase angle.
        C: Constant offset.

    Returns:
        Position values at the given time points.
    """
    return A * np.exp(-gamma * t) * np.cos(w * t + phi) + C
```

3. **Let `curve_fit` Work Its Magic**: This is where the excitement builds. I feed the data points and my chosen function (the damped oscillation model) into `curve_fit`. This function employs a clever optimization algorithm to adjust the model's parameters until it best matches the data.

4. **Parameter Extraction**: After the optimization done, I extract the best-fit parameters. These parameters are like the missing pieces of my puzzle, allowing me to quantify the motion's amplitude, omega, damping coefficient, and phase.

```py
x_data = data[:, 0]
y_data = data[:, 1]

params, _ = curve_fit(
    underdamped_harmonic_oscillator,
    x_data,
    y_data,
    p0=initial_guess,
    bounds=(lower_bounds, upper_bounds),
    maxfev=2500,
    ftol=1e-6,
)

# Extract the fitted parameters
A, gamma, w, phi, C = params
```

The Result? A beautifully fitted curve that elegantly captures the essence of harmonic motion. It's akin to assembling a puzzle and revealing the complete picture.

# Physics

Now, let's explore the fascinating physics behind harmonic motion in a way that's easy to understand. Imagine we have a system—a mass attached to a spring with a damper—and it's doing some interesting things.

## The Second-Order ODE: What's That?

In the realm of physics, we often describe the motion of objects using mathematical equations. In our system, we employ a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):

Here's the equation in its mathematical form:

$$
m \frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + \gamma \frac{dx(t)}{dt} + kx(t) = 0
$$

Here's what each component means:

- $$ x(t) $$ is the object's position at time $$t$$.
- $$\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$$ is its velocity, and $$\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2}$$ is its acceleration.
- $$m$$ is the object's mass.
- $$\gamma$$ represents damping coefficient, which resists motion.
- $$k$$ is the spring constant, indicating how stiff the spring is.

This equation is essential for understanding our system's physics.

### The Harmonic Solution: It's Beautiful

Now, here's the cool part. When conditions are right (meaning the damping isn't too strong), our system behaves in a super cool way. We can describe its motion with a beautiful equation:

$$
x(t) = A e^{-\gamma t} \cos(\omega t + \phi) + C
$$

Let me break it down:

- $$A$$ is the amplitude, which is like how far our mass swings.
- $$\gamma$$ represents damping coefficient, which resists motion.
- $$\omega$$ is the angular frequency.
- $$\phi$$ is the phase angle.
- $$C$$ is just a constant that might shift our motion up or down.

### Relating to a Damped Pendulum

You might wonder, how is this related to a damped pendulum? Well, it turns out, the equations are pretty similar! In the case of a damped pendulum, instead of a mass moving along a spring, we have a bob swinging on a string.

The equation for a damped pendulum looks like this:

$$
\frac{d^2\theta(t)}{dt^2} + 2\gamma \frac{d\theta(t)}{dt} + \omega_0^2\theta(t) = 0
$$

- $$\theta(t)$$ is the angle our pendulum makes with the vertical.
- $$\gamma$$ represents damping coefficient, which resists motion.
- $$\omega_0$$ is the natural angular frequency of the pendulum, and it depends on the length of the string and gravity.

### Why $$\omega$$ Matters

In both systems, the value of $$\omega$$ is super important! It tells us how fast things are moving or swinging. For a pendulum, it's linked to the length of the string. It's like the heartbeat of our system, determining how it behaves over time.

## Measuring Pendulum String Length

Let's explore a clever method for measuring the length ($$L$$) of a pendulum string, taking into account the damped conditions of the pendulum's motion. This approach is not only ingenious but also practical, especially when dealing with complex pendulum systems.

### Step 1: Analyzing Damped Harmonic Motion

Our first step involves carefully observing the pendulum's harmonic motion under damped conditions. We need to record essential data, with a keen focus on determining the angular frequency ($$\omega$$) that characterizes the pendulum's oscillation in the presence of damping.

### Step 2: The Damped $$\omega$$ and $$L$$ Relationship

The angular frequency ($$ω$$) for a damped pendulum system can be expressed in terms of the natural angular frequency ($$ω_0$$) and the damping coefficient ($$γ$$) as follows:

$$
ω = \sqrt{ω_0^2 - γ^2}
$$

Where:

- $$ω$$ is the angular frequency of the damped pendulum.
- $$ω_0$$ is the natural angular frequency (undamped) of the pendulum, given by $$ω_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$$, where $$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $$L$$ is the length of the pendulum.
- $$γ$$ (gamma) is the damping coefficient, representing the strength of damping in the system.

This formula accounts for the effect of damping on the oscillatory motion of the pendulum. When $$γ$$ is non-zero, it reduces the angular frequency $$ω$$ from its undamped value $$ω_0$$, resulting in damped oscillations.

The formula for the natural angular frequency ($$\omega_0$$) of an undamped pendulum is given by:

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}
$$

Where:

- $$\omega_0$$ is the natural angular frequency of the undamped pendulum.
- $$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
- $$L$$ is the length of the pendulum.

This equation tells us that the natural angular frequency ($$\omega_0$$) is inversely proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum ($$L$$). Therefore, longer pendulums have smaller natural angular frequencies, and shorter pendulums have larger natural angular frequencies.

### Step 3: Determining $$L$$

We can rearrange the equation to calculate the length of the pendulum string ($$L$$):

$$
L = \frac{g}{\omega_0^2}
$$

### Step 4: Handling Compound Pendulums

A compound pendulum, also known as a physical pendulum, is different from a simple pendulum because it has an extended mass distribution rather than a point mass at the end of a string. To calculate the angular frequency ($$\omega_0$$) for a compound pendulum, you need to consider the moment of inertia (MOI) of the pendulum about its pivot point.

The moment of inertia ($$I$$) depends on the shape and distribution of mass in the pendulum. The moment of inertia of the spherical bob about its center is given by:

$$
I_{\text{bob}} = \frac{2}{5} m r^2
$$

Where:

- $$m$$ is the mass of the spherical bob.
- $$r$$ is the radius of the spherical bob.

The moment of inertia of the pendulum about its pivot point, taking into account both the bob and the string, is the sum of the moments of inertia of the bob and the string:

$$
I = I_{\text{bob}} + ml^2
$$

Where:

- $$I$$ is the moment of inertia of the compound pendulum about its pivot point.
- $$ml^2$$ represents the moment of inertia of the string of length $$l$$.

Now, you can use the formula for the natural frequency ($$\omega_0$$) of the compound pendulum:

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{mgd}{I}}
$$

Where:

- $$\omega_0$$ is the natural frequency of the compound pendulum.
- $$m$$ is the mass of the pendulum.
- $$g$$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
- $$d$$ is the distance between the pivot point and the center of mass of the pendulum.
- $$I$$ is the moment of inertia of the pendulum about the pivot point.

So, we can say $$\omega_0$$ (natural frequency of a damped pendulum) is a function of both length ($$L$$) and radius ($$r$$).
