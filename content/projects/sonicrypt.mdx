#### User Workflow

1. The seller generates a QR code using the Sonicrypt app.
2. The buyer scans the QR code using their wallet app.
3. The buyer sends the payment to the seller.
4. The Sonicrypt device plays a sound and lights up when the payment is confirmed.
5. The seller provides the product to the buyer.
6. The transaction is complete.

#### How it Works

1. The Sonicrypt device connects to the blockchain network (Solana) websocket to listen for account changes.
2. It listens to changes in the seller's wallet address.
3. When a change is detected, it retrieves the last transaction signature.
4. It fetches the transaction details using the signature.
5. If the transaction is successful, the Sonicrypt device plays a sound and lights up.

### 2. Sonicrypt App

The Sonicrypt App is a mobile application that allows users to connect and configure their Sonicrypt devices. It serves as an interface for interacting with the device and managing aspects of the crypto transaction process.

## Open-Source and No Hidden Costs

Sonicrypt is an open-source project, and we are committed to keeping it that way. The device does not connect to any servers or third-party services, ensuring privacy and transparency. It is a standalone device that you can use without any subscription fees or hidden costs. Both the software and hardware are open-source, allowing you to modify and customize the solution according to your needs.
